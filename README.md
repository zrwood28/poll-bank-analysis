Analysis of both financial and voting data.

## PyBank
For this project, a CSV file containing monthly profit margin values was analyzed. The final output includes the total time span that the data covers, the total amount
netted over the time frame, the average change in monthly profit values, as well as the greatest increase and decrease in profit in a month to month period.

## PyPoll
This project instead analyzed data that contained electoral voting information. First, the total number of votes were counted. These votes were then broken down and 
totaled for each individual candidate and given a corresponding percentage. The winner was then declared based off of the vote totals.
